Use of machine learning for anomaly detection in netflow data
=============================================================

This notebook can be viewed directly on `github <https://github.com/eraclitux/machine-learning-netflow/blob/master/machinelearning-netflow.ipynb>`_.

A readable version of this ipython notebook can also be found `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/eraclitux/machine-learning-netflow/blob/master/machinelearning-netflow.ipynb>`_.

Note
====

I've no longer access to any netflow data collector. I'd like to develop a service (and open source it ;-)) that applies ml alghoritms to this data to automatically spot anomalies. If someone is interested and has a collector with ``nfdump`` installed, which I can have ssh access to, please contact me!
